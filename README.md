# Android_Mobile_Programming
We have introduced on basic Android java programing. For creating Android app we have set up Android Studio (IDE) in our machine and we have make ready the provided Samsung android base tablet for development work by configuring some parameter on developer options like enabling or selecting USB debugging, Stay awake, Allow mock location and so on. I have tested the development environment by importing and running the provided Fruit Slick app and the result was successful.

I also familiarize myself and played around with files and folders exists on project explorer windows i.e Manifest file, the res folder, and the src folder which contain the java code files(ex. MainActivity.java).
We have learned also about Android application fundamentals :SDK - Source Developing Kit  a package of tools needed for developing apps and used to compile our Android code and APK : the format in which our apps will eventually be distributed and this file contains all the contents of an Android app.

We have also introduced with the four types of app components (i.e Activities, Services, Content providers, Broadcast receivers)and how each type serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how the component is created and destroyed.
Among the four app compontes we have seen in detail about Activities ; how to creat activity, implement user interface, declaring activity in manifest and finally we learned on   Managing the Activity Lifecycle by implementing callback
We have learned three states of an activity:

Resumed - The activity is in the foreground of the screen and has user focus. 
Paused- Another activity is in the foreground and has focus, but this one is still visible. 
Stopped- The activity is completely obscured by another activity 

When an activity transitions into and out of the different states designated above, it is notified through various callback methods. All of the callback methods are hooks that can override to do appropriate work when the state of your activity changes. 

In general the first lecture was wonderful and i have learned some basics on Android programming which are a solid foundation for next lectures.
